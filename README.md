# Feature_scaling_standardization
Feature Scaling is a technique to standardize the independent features present in the data in a fixed range. It is performed during the data pre-processing to handle highly varying magnitudes or values or units. Here we see the effect of scaling  in different algorithms and how to perform and visualize these effects
